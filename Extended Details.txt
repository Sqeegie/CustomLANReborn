===== Features =====
The ability to enter custom IPs and ports in the singleplayer LAN menu. Other vanilla server options such can be set in the configuration file, such as:

- Allow Flight (True/False)
- Allow PvP (True/False)
- Can Spawn Animals (True/False)
- Can Spawn NPCs (True/False)
- Message of the Day (String)
- Max Players (Integer)
- Online Mode (True/False)
- Advanced Debug Msgs (True/False)

In addition to manually changing these in the config file, there is a in-game config editor.
