KNOWN BUGS:
- /help <randomnumber> will crash the game - May have to do with the /publish command.
- Entering the IP for a tunneling program like Hamachi causes bind error and fails to work.

TODO LIST:
- Check to make sure all the commands, server options (allow flight, online mode, ect) are actually working after the code cleanup.
- Fix incorrect IP error when putting in Hamachi's IP.
- Fix/Finish permissions.
- Fix /help crash. (By using ASM to remove vanilla's command register for /help?)
- Add missing commands. (Op, deop, ban, unban, reloadops, spawnmob, ect.)
- Finish implementing the new developer debug messages

- Update to 1.8 and above?!?!?
- Continue to clean and refactor code.
